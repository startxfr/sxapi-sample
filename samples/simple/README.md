This section show you some sample config file for building microservices based on basic services. Theses samples must be used with sxapi-core engine (dev) 

SXAPI
=====
SXAPI for [Simple and eXtensible Application Programming Interface](https://github.com/startxfr/sxapi-core) 
is an open-source project for building simple and small microservices quickly and efficiently.

SAMPLE LIST
===========
[1. microservice based on static response](hello/README.md)
[2. microservice based on static HTML response](html/README.md)
[3. microservice based on static JSON response](json/README.md)
[4. microservice based on dynamic module response](module/README.md)
