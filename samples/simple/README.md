# sxapi Simple Samples

This section show you some sample config file for building microservices based on basic services. Theses samples must be used with sxapi-core engine (v0.0.8) 

SXAPI
=====
SXAPI for [Simple and eXtensible Application Programming Interface](https://github.com/startxfr/sxapi-core) 
is an open-source project for building simple and small microservices quickly and efficiently.

INSTALLING YOU ENVIRONEMENT
===========================
Use the [sxapi-installer](https://github.com/startxfr/sxapi-installer/blob/v0.0.8/README.md) toget a full workstation environement with 
[sxapi-console-cli](https://github.com/startxfr/sxapi-console/blob/v0.0.8/docs/2.CLI.md) ready to use
Versionning is an important part of a microservice architecture. Be sure to follow the [developper guidline](https://github.com/startxfr/sxapi-core/blob/v0.0.8/docs/2.Develop.md) to get a good worling environement
